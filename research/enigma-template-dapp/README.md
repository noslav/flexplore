This repository provides the source code accompanying the article [Getting Started with the Enigma Protocol: A Complete Developer’s Guide](https://medium.com/@apalepu23/getting-started-with-the-enigma-protocol-170b7dfa5c0f). After reading the guide, and using this repository as a template, you will be on your way to develop **secret contracts** with the Enigma protocol. 

At Enigma, our mission is to build the first platform for scalable, privacy-preserving smart contracts, which will enable end-to-end decentralized applications. Centralized applications, acting as single points of trust and consequently single points of failure, open themselves up to data breaches, identity theft, and other manifestations of security violations. Decentralized applications work to mitigate these issues, but unfortunately can’t do so in a scalable, privacy-preserving manner. With the launch of Enigma Testnet 1.0, we provided developers with the first taste of writing secret contracts and dApps that interact with them: [announcement](https://blog.enigma.co/the-code-is-here-announcing-enigma-testnet-1-0-release-accdaf051950) and [Github repo](https://github.com/enigmampc/enigma-docker-network).
