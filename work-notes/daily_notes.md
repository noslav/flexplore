The Big picture - 
Centralized Credit Scoring - Social credit score, solutions created by central third parties have come to be viewed as insecure at best and dystopian at worst.

	1. Blockchain-based borrowing holds the possibility of improving on the legacy model of lending
	2. The borrower’s credit is based on his historical behavior and current financial status.
	3. Today, credit scoring is generally a centralized process that relies on attestations from a single authority or an oligopoly.
	4. Rather than rely on attestations by a single authority or an oligopoly, lenders can use a web of trust model.
	5.  more decentralized approach and provide lenders only with their on-chain funds and transaction history as a proxy for credit score.

	7. In order to enable a fuller spectrum of decentralized lending, some of these options for credit scoring need to be explored.
	8. Attestations could go beyond historical transactions and extend to KYC/AML, accredited investor status, or even governments attesting citizenship, residency, and visas.

	1.Decentralized loan pricing is a super tough problem — the sci-fi, long-term solution is that when we have reliable decentralized identities and a debtor’s entire loan history is on-chain (*hopefully* with something like Dharma) and privately tied to their identity, so a debtor would be able to compute a zero-knowledge proof of some sort of creditworthiness metric (i.e. naively, sum of value repaid in loans / sum of value borrowed) and present that to potential creditors as their credit score while maintaining their credit history’s privacy. Note that this is somewhat possible for DAOs today (imagine a DAO issuing bonds, for instance)— less-so for individuals given that decentralized identity hasn’t quite caught yet. 
	2. In the short-term — the best mitigation to relying on a singular party is likely having some sort of federated model + staking to make underwriters have more “skin in the game” — i.e. 5 institutions stake their confidence on a creditworthiness prediction for a debtor, and get slashed commensurately if reality doesn’t fall in line with their predictions.
